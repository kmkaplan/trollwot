gnupg
=====

This is a fork of gnupg 1.4.13 where I removed all the entropy from key generation. It generates keys really quickly, but they're all insecure.

python-gnupg
============

This is the gnupg python module that Isis maintains. It has extra features.

python-gnupg-0.3.3
==================

This is the original unmodified python-gnupg 0.3.3.
